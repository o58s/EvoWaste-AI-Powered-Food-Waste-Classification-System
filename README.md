EvoWaste is a full-stack AI application designed to help users classify and track their food waste using real-time image recognition. The system uses a YOLO deep learning model trained on a custom dataset I created using Roboflow, allowing accurate classification of waste into four categories: Edible, Animal Feed, Compostable, and Non-Reusable.

During development, I debugged complex backend logic, file handling, and model predictions to ensure smooth functionality and accurate results.

Key Features:
 • 🔍 AI Waste Classification — Users upload an image, and YOLO predicts the category with confidence scores.
 • 📊 Personal History Tracking — Every classification is stored with date, time, location, confidence, and image preview.
 • 🌍 Location-Based Tracking — Captures user location for analytics or future heat-map insights.
 • 🧑‍💻 Full User System — Sign up, login, session management, and profile editing.
 • 🗄️ MySQL Database Integration — Scalable database for users, classifications, and timestamps.
 • 🎨 Modern UI/UX with JavaScript — Interactive frontend with drag-and-drop uploads, loaders, and dynamic result display.

Tech Stack:
 • Python, Flask, YOLO (Ultralytics)
 • MySQL
 • HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 • Computer Vision & Image Processing
 • Roboflow for dataset creation and annotation

This project strengthened my full-stack development skills, AI integration, dataset creation, and ability to debug complex systems in real-world applications.
